Shared hosting means running more than one website on a single machine, with each website has its own Domain Name.
Most of the users share the same resources on a single server, which keeps the costs low. 

Each user gets a portion of a server in which they can host their website files. 
The hosting company will put your website on a server along with hundreds, if not thousands, of other websites. 

Each customer using the shared hosting platform’s server has access to features like databases, 
monthly traffic, disk space, email accounts, FTP accounts and other add-ons offered by the host.

This means each customer has to share space and resources on the server with every other customer, including CPU time, 
memory, disk space, and other elements such as the single MySQL server, Apache server, and mail server.

Shared hosting is the most affordable option. Having multiple users on a single physical server dilutes 
the price for individual users. Hence, shared hosting is best suited for businesses that do not have the 
resources and expertise to manage their own dedicated servers. 

It’s easy to get started with shared hosting compared to other hosting options.[2]
