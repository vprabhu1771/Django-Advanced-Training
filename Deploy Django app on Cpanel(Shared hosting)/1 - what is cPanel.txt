The cPanel Control Panel is more than a regular website management tool. 

CPanel is a fully-featured browser-based control panel that allows you to manage your domain hosting 
through a web interface. 

It provides a graphical interface (GUI) and automation tools designed to ease 
the process of hosting a website to the website owner or the “end-user”.
