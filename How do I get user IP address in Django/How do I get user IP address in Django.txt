Get the ip address with this function:

def get_ip_address(request):
    x_forwarded_for = request.META.get('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR')
    if x_forwarded_for:
        ip = x_forwarded_for.split(',')[0]
    else:
        ip = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')
    return ip


after that you can get the user location data and other info from that web app http://www.iplocinfo.com/:


import requests
def get_ip_data(request):
    ip_address = get_ip_address(request)
    api_key = "your api key"
    endPoint = f'https://www.iplocinfo.com/api/v1/{ip_address}?apiKey={api_key}'
    data = requests.get(endPoint)
    return data.json()
